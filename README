Description
-----------

FlashCanvas is a JavaScript library which adds the HTML5 Canvas support
to Internet Explorer. It renders shapes and images via Flash drawing
API, and runs much faster than other similar libraries which use VML or
Silverlight.


Requirements
------------

 * Microsoft Internet Explorer
 * Adobe Flash Player 9 or later


Usage
-----

Copy the files flashcanvas.js and flashcanvas.swf into some directory on
a Web server, and then add the following line to your HTML file.

    <!--[if IE]><script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/flashcanvas.js"></script><![endif]-->

That's all you have to do in most cases. For more details, please see
the project page.
