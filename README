FlashCanvas
===========

An implementation of the HTML5 Canvas API for Internet Explorer.


Description
-----------

FlashCanvas is a JavaScript library which adds the HTML5 Canvas support
to Internet Explorer. It renders shapes and images via Flash drawing
API, and in many cases, runs faster than other similar libraries which
use VML or Silverlight.


Requirements
------------

 * Microsoft Internet Explorer
 * Adobe Flash Player 9 or later


Usage
-----

Copy the files flashcanvas.js and flashcanvas.swf into some directory on
a Web server, and then add the following line to your HTML file.

    <!--[if IE]><script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/flashcanvas.js"></script><![endif]-->

That's all you have to do in most cases. For more details, please see
